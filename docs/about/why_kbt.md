# What is Knowledge Base?

A knowledge base is a collection of articles that provide useful answers, recommendations, and other vital information about your product or service that customers can find in one convenient spot. It's the single source of truth for your consumers while they're learning how to use your product or service, and it's a perfect strategy to empower them to fix their own problems with self-service support.

You can help your customers find the answers they need while also saving your support team's valuable time and resources by publishing articles for your most popular concerns. You can take your content a step further with modern conversational support solutions and offer assistance in context to the right customers at the right time - while they're using your product or visiting your website.
