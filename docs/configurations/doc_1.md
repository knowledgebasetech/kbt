## Creating a Category or Section

The app refers to the `docs` folder in the root directory of the project for your content. You can make folders inside the `docs` folder that represent the different sections of your knowledge base.

Inside each section folder, you can create a `README.md` file that contains the title and description of the section, using the following format:

Once you have your section folder and it's README.md file, you can start adding your content to the section. You can simply create a `.md` file inside the section folder and add your content to it.
